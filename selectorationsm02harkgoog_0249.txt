records made at that time by the different praetore, those of Metellus
alone were trustworthy.

ro proceeds to contrast the records made by Metellus, in which the
name of Archias appears, with those made by his associateS, Appius
Claudius and Q. Gabinius. Those of Appius were not properly taken
care of. Forgeries might have been introduced into them. The reck·
lessness of GabiniuS, and his condemnation on the charge of extortiou,
destroyed the value of his register3 but the records of Metellus were ex-
ecuted and preserved with the most scrupulous care.

16. Quam diu incolumis fuit3 i. e., before he was tried, in con-
trast with post damnationem. Gabinius was tried and condemned on the
charge of extortion.

tas, taken separately.

Of the actor was deemed unworthy of freemen.

tatem datam; i. e., after the franchise was given ‘to the allied cities
