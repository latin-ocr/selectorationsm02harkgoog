PREFACE.

 

'Pras edition ¹of Cicero's Select Orations has been
prepared expressly for school use. The ten orations
which. it contains are fine specimens of Roman elo·
quence in its various departments—forensic, senatorial,
and judicial. They are arranged in the order in which,
it is thought, they can be read to the best advantage.

The Notes, to each oration are preceded by an in-
troduction and by an analysis of the argument. They
are arranged topically in such a manner as to keep the
general scope of thought as constantly as possible be-
fore the mind of the student. It is hoped that this
feature of the work will aid the instructor in his efforts
to interest his pupils, and to develop in them habits of
thought and of critical study.

It is the aim of the Notes to give the faithful stu-

dent the key to all really difficult passages, and, at the
same time, to furnish him such collateral information

upon Roman manners and customs, upon Roman his-
tory and life, as will enable him to understand, appre-
ciate, and enjoy these masterpieces of Roman oratory.
, In carrying out this purpose, however, care has been

. taken not to interfere with that course of direct instruc-

tion and illustration which belongs exclusively to the
