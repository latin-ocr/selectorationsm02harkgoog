30. Hosne maiorum ν Supply ee impedit. The country personi-
fied proceeds to consider the three excuses which the consul might urge
for not having put Catiline ιο death: the custom of his ancestors, the
lawe, and the dread of unpopularity.-At. . .multarunt. The answer
to the first ground of defenoe.—Persaepe privati. We have undoubt-
edly a rhetorical exaggeration in the use of persam and of the plural
privati. The only illustration which Cicero gives us is P. Scipio, pontifex
maximus. See p. 1, line 20.

³1.An leges. The second ground of defence, that the laws—the
Valet-ian, the Porcian, and the Sempronian—forbade that a Roman citizen
should be put to death without the sanction of the mpla—Quae ro-
gatae sunt, which have been enadad. Leyem rogare is the common for-
mula in putting the question on the passage of a law: hence to enad a
law.

³2. At nunquam. The answer to the second ground of defence:
“But,'‘ says the country, “those who have withdrawn their allegiance
from the state are no longer citizens.’'

34. Praeclaram vero. . ,gn-utiam, remarkable yratitude in εηιιΙι
you εΙιοω ,· in irony. See Syn. L. G. 548, 3.

35. Per te cognitum, known by your-sels alone, i. e., by your own
exertions, instead of being recommended to popular favor by illustrious
ancestry. Cicero was the first of his family who attained any of the
higher offices of state.

36. Tam mature, so early. Cicero was elected to the consulship
at the age of forty-tw0, the earliest age at which any citizen was eligible
to that high office.

1. Summum imperitum i. e., the consulship.—Per omnes
gradus, · i. e., the quaestorship, aedileship‚ praetorship, and consulship.

4. severitatis invidia, unpopularity incurred by severity, lit. ,os
severity.

7. Invidiae incendio conflagraturum. A figurative expression
suggested by tecta ardebunt.

8. His. . ,respondebo See note on etenim, p. 10, line 20.-Εο-
rum mentibus, the thouyllts of those.

9. Hoc idem ; i. e., that Catiline ought to be put to death.

10. optimum sactu, the best chiny to do.—optimum; G. 373, 3.
—Factu3 G. 570.—Judicarem, ιιοιι dedissem, is I judqed (both
then and now), I would not leave yiven. The Imperfect is used in the con-
dition, in preference to the Pluperfect, to show that his judgment still
remains unchanged. G. 5103 510, 1.

11. Catilinam. . .multari; in apposition with hoa—Gladia-
tori; a term of reproach.
