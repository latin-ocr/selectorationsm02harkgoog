fortunately frustrated by a mistake on the part of Catiline, who l
gave the signal before his accomplices were ready for action. ¹

In June, 64 Β. O„ Catiline resumed his revolutionary schcmes
on a larger scale and with renewed energy. Rome at that time
furnished him abundant materials for such a work in the throngs
of luxui-ious spendthriftS, desperate insolventS‚ and reckless ad—
venturerS, who filled her streete. He soon numbered among his
accomplices eleven senatore, four members of the equ estrian order,
and several men of position and influence in the provincial townS.
Thus strengthened, he boldly presented himself as a candidate for
the consulship, but defeat awaited him. Marcus Cicero the ora-
tor and Caius Antonius were elected consule, the former by an
overwhelming majority. '⁹

This was a severe disappointment for Catinae, but it only
rendered him more reckless than ever in his revolutionary designs.
He had entered upon a desperate game, and he resolved to hazard
every thing, to win or die. He established the headquarters of
his movement at Faesulae, in Etruria, under the command of
Gaius ManliuS, an insolvent and revolutionist, who had served
as a centurion under Sulla. He raised money upon his own
credit and that of his friends, collected stores of arms at conven-

of all ranks, His audacity aimed at nothing less than the over·
throw of the governrnent. He proposed to seize al] the offices
of trust and exnolument, to cancel debts‚ to confiscate the prop-

Sulla's proscriptions.

It was at such a crisis, that on the first of Jan'uary in that
memorahle year, 63 B. G„ (Dicere, the accomplished orator and
scholar, entered upon the arduous and perilous duties of the con-
sulship. A base and nefarious conspiracy against the government
was rapidly consummating its work, a bloody revolution was im-
minent, and even his own colleague in the consulship, Gaius An-
toniuS, was supposed to be more or less in sympathy with the
treasonable movement. But Cicero proved himself equal to the
emergeney. He secured the passive cooperation of Antonius b)-
offering, at the outset, to transfer to him the rich province of
Macedonia at the expiration of his term of office. He, moreover‚
