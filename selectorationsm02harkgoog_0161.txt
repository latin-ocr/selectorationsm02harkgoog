ORATION S AGAIN ST CATILINE. 139

opened communication with Quintus Curius, one of the accom-
plices of Oatiline, and, by means of large promises, engaged him
to keep the government informed in regard to all the movements
of the conspirator& Curius proved a faithful and trustworthy
agent. ·

When the consular election for 62 B. O. approached, Catiline,
once more a. candidate, determined not to suffer another defeat.
He accordingly adopted the bold project of murdering the pre-
siding consul, and, if need be, the rival candidate8‚ and of carry-

election was deferred until the twenty-first of October, and, after-

agents at once promised to call upon the consul the next morning
and assassinatc him in his own house3 but CicerO, forewarned in
regard to their purpose, refused to admit them.

On the seventh of November, the senate met, for greater se-
curity, in the Temple of Jupiter Stator, which was guarded by
Roman knights, Catiline, contrary to the expectation of all, had
the effrontery to present himself at the meeting, but no greeting
welcomed him to his accustomed place3 the seats in his vicinity
were instantly vacated3 the traitor sat alone, an object of scorn
