7. Oppressum Participle limiting nemo.

8. Adsciverit3 G. 501, I.; 482, 2.

Secuti erunt; G. 473, 2.—Sui comites3 i. e., his associates and ac-
complices who remained in Rome after the departure of Catiline.

19. Ο nos beatos. This exclamation, it will be observed, is the

emphatic than the declarative sorm, erimm boati, would have been. On
the construction of noc, see G. 381.
