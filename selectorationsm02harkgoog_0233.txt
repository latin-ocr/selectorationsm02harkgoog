FOURTH ORATION AGAINST CATILINE. 205

PAO!

2. Mem-um.. .rationeS, comderatiom of my «lawyers. 41

4„ Majorum eiuS. The Julian gene, to which Caesar belonged, had
long been illustiious ,-

5. Intellectum est, it zoas per-ceived, i. e., as he spoke3 Perfect
Indefinite: hence inim-esset, not intersit.

⁷. Saluti populi consulentem. These words are added to de-
fine the term ’vere popularem. The learner must not fail to notice the
different senses in which this term is used. Coming as it does from
populu-3, its primary signification is belonyz‘nq to, or relatiny to, tlte people.
With this general meaning it has three principal applicatione: 1. Belonq-
in9 ιο tlte party of tlte people, a political application3 2. Devoted to the im
tereste of the people, as in this instance and in line 223 3. Ηαυύιρ ίΙιει
favor of tlte people, popular in the usual sense of the term, as in line 26.
Caesar belonged politically to the party of the people; the term popu»
laris was, therefore, applicable to him in the first sense, and Cicero here
pays him the flattering compliment of applying it to him in the second
sense.

9. Non neminem, some one. Observe the different-e between non
nemo and ‘nemo non. G. 585, 1. It is not known who this senator
was.-—De capite. Questions which thus involved the life of a Ro-
man citizen could be tried only before the Centuriate Assembly. The
senate, therefore, had no legal right to condemn the conspirators to
death.

10. N adius tertius3 also written as one word—nunc dies tertius,
the day before yeslerday.

12. Jam, now ,· i. e., in view of these factS, marking a connection
of thought, not mere time—Hoc, this, explained by quid de tota. . ‚ju-
dicarit, which should be construed before qui rec, etc.

13. Qui, he who, The omitted antecedent of qui is the pronoun ie,
the subject of judicarit.—Quaesitori gratulationem, a thanksqiviny
in honor of (lit.‚ to) the investigatio& officer, referring to Cicer0‚ who con-
ducted in person the investigation in the senate two days before.

15. At vero C. Caesam in contrast with the senator just men-
tioned—Legem Semproniam. Caesar, in opposing the sentence of
capital punishment, had appealed to certain statuteS, among which was
the Sempronian law, which provided spat the punishment of death should
not be inflicted upon a Roman citizen without the vote of the people.
To this Cicero replies that the enemies of the state are not citizens, and,
therefore, not protected by this law,

1⁷. Civem3 Predicate Accus.-1psum latorem. . .dependisse;
i. e., C. GracchuS, the very author of this law, was put to death as a

public enemy, wi1t.150ut trial before the people. Hence Catiline and other
