embarked for Greece by way of Syracuse ; but having been driven
back by unfavorable winds to Leucopetra, on the southern coast
of Italy, he was informed that favorable tidings had recently been
received from Rome, that. there was a prospect of a complete
reconciliation of parties, and that the state needed his presence
and counsel. Accordingly, abandoning his contemplated visit to
Greece, he hastened to Rome, where he arrived on the thirty-
first of August. But his expectations were again disappointed.
Antony, whose power was still unchecked, had summoned the
senate to meet on the following day, to decree new honors to
ansar's memory. Cicero exoused himself from attending, on the
ground of fatigue and ill health3 but Antony, losing his sels-pos-
session, rose in his place and assailed the absent senator with a
tirade of abuse. On the following day, the senate was again in
session, but Antony found it convenient to be absent. Cicero
was present, and, in the course of the debate, delivered his First
Philippica* It was a masterly effert. With calm dignity and per-
fect self-possession‚ he explained his own course, stated his views
of the duties of the hour, and exposed the ambitious designs of
Antony.
