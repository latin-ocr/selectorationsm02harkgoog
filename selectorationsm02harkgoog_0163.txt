ORATIONs AGAINST CATILINE. 141

ing the signatures of Lentulus», Cethegus, and Statilius, was read-
ily obtained. The Gallie ambassadorS, having finished their work,
left Rome on the night of the second of December, accompanied
by Titus Volturcius, the bearer of dispatches for Catiline, but they
had proceeded only a short distance beyond the city gate when
they fell into the hands of an armed force in the employ of the
government. LentuluS, Cethegus, Statilius, and Gabinius, were
arrested the next morning. Later in the day, the prisoners were
all brought before the bar of the senate, then assembled in the
· Temple of Concord. The evidence of their guilt was overwhelm-
ing, and was finally confirmed by their own confessionS.
, After the adjournment of the senate, Cicero addressed the
people on the great events of the day in his Third Oration
aqainet Catiline. The indignation against the conspirators be-
came almost ungovernable; execrations were heaped upon Cati·
line3 Cicero was the hero of the hour.

On the fifth of December, the senate met in the Temple of
Concord, to decide the fate of the prisonem. D. Junius Silanus,
consul—elect, recommended the punishment of death, but O. Julius
Caesar, praetor-elect, obj ected to capital punishment as illegal, and
recommended imprisonment for life. It was in the course of this
(lebate that Cicero pronounced his Fourth Oration aqainst Gati-
line. The sentence of death was decreed by the senate, and ex-
ecuted that very night, under the direction of the consul himself.

In the mean time, Oatiline was in Etruria at the head of a
formidable force, where, in the ensuing spring, he was defeated
in a desperate contest, and fen in the thickest of the fight.
