living teacher, but rather to prepare the way for it, and
to give efficiency to it.

In the preparation of the N otes, important aid has
been derived from the excellent editions of Cicero's
Orations by Halm, Klotz, Orusius, Long, and others.

The Text is tho result of a careful collation of the
several editions most approved by European scholare.
It is based,‘however, chiefly upon the critical labors of
Halm and Klotz.

The Illustrations, taken from Forsyth's ‘⁶ Life of
Oicero,'’ will, it is hoped, be found both interesting and
instructive.

In this connection Ι am happy to acknowledge my
obligations to my esteemed friend, Mr. Edward H. Out-
ler, the accomplished Principal of the Classical Depart-

ment of the Providence High-School. He has gener· >

ously given me the benefit of his accurate scholar-
ship and large professional experieuce, by placing at
my disposal a valuable collection of notes, suggestions,
and other materials, which have been of great service
to me in the preparation of this work.

In conclusion, I desire to make my grateful ac-
kuowledgments to the classica] instructore throughout
the country who have received my previous works with
such marked favor, and have used them with such fidel·
ity and skill. To their hands this volume is now re·
spectfully committed.
