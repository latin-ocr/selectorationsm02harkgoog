Dmormm, in whose defence this oration was delivered, was
tetrarch of Galatia, in 'Asia Minor. In the Mithridatio ‚War he
supported the Roman cause so warmly that the senate, in recog-

granted his petition‚ but also restored to him his kingly title and
his royal robes.

slave, accompanied the embassy‚ but was finally won over by
Castor, and j0ined in the accusation. The case was tried before
