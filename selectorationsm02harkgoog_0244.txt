48 tio). He places the theon-diod knowledqe (ratio) last, because he wishes
to call special attention to it, as he had derived it largely from his
toacher, Archias—J udices. This word is usually rendered ἐπᾶραι, but
the duties of the judica were not the same as those of judqoe with ηε,
but rather those of our jur-ors. In this trial the judiees do not preside,
but the praetor, Quintus Tullius Cicera—Quod sentio. . exiguum,
and I perceive how small it is. Quod, subject of sit. G. 525.

3. Mediocriter versatum, moderately well versed. Huiusce rei
—dloendi; i. e., of oratory.

4. Ab prosecta, derived from—Optimarum artium3 i. e., phi·
losophy, history, grammar, rhetoric, and poetry.—A qua, from which,
i. e., from the study or pursuit of it. Qua refers to ratione.

5. Abhorruisse, has been free. Cicero was ever a diligent student.
During the busiest periods of his life, he devoted his leisure hours to

¹ reading and study.

6. Earum rerum3 i. e., the three requisites mentioned above—A.
Licinius 3 i. e., A. Licinius Archias—Fructum a me. . .debet. Cice·
ro thinks that his teacher, Archias, is fairly entitled to share the fruit
of the instructions which he had imparted to him in youth.

7. Repetere, to demand in return, i. e., for his instructions—Prope
suo jure, as almost his own by riyht, lit., almost in (by) his own riyht.
Prope is added, as suo jure without such qualification, would be too
strong—Quoad longissime . . ‚respicere, as sar back as my mind can
possibly review.

9. Ultimum, tlte earliest—Inde usque repetens, recalliny even
srom ἰῘιαι period. Archias came to Rome when Cicero was only five
years of age.

10. Hunc mihi principem exstitisse, that he was my chief
quide.

11. Rationem. . . studiorum, this course of stud-q (studies).

12. Consormata, trained—Nonnullis saluti3 G. 390.

13. Α quo. The antecedent is huic ipsi, which with the antecedent
clause is best rendered first—Quo, by which, referring to id.—Ceteris, .
alios, Ceteris means the others, the -rest, i. e., all except Archias; but
tilios means others, i. e., others in contrast with Archias; not, however,
all others, but some others. ,

16. Hoc ita. Ila is added only for emphasis. The thought would
be complete without it.—Quod sit; G. 520, ΙΙ.

17. In hoc, in this man, i. e., in Archias—N eque haec dicendi
ratio, and not this knowledqe of oratory. As Archias was a poet, and

not an orator, some might wonder that Cicero should feel so much in·
›debted to him.
