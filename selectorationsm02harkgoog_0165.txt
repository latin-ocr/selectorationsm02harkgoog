probably guarded, though it was also under the protection of the force
upon the Palatine3 hence munitiaaimus.

6. Habendi senatum G. 5623 598, 3.—0ra vultusque. Ob-
serve the difference of meaning—ora referring to the featureS, the sace3
vultu-3, to the expression of the face, the looks. The looks of surprise
and indignation with which the senate received Catiline as he took his
scat in that body are here meant.

7. Non sentis, non vides (line 8); G. 346, ΙΙ. 1, 2).—Constric-
tam teneri, is held in check.

9. Proxima, superiore nocte, last night, the niyht before ‚· Abl.
of Time. One of the events to which Cicero here refers is the meeting
at the house of Laeca, which took place on the night before the last
(superiore noete), the other is probably the attempt upon the life of Cicero,
which may not bave been actually made until the next night after the
meeting‚ though Catiline's agents offered to make it that very night. It
ie, however, entirely possible that Cicero here refers to some other move-
ment on the part os Catiline. For an account of the mceting at thc house
oi* Laeca and of the attempt upon the life of Cicero, sce p. 4, and Intro-
duction, p. 139.-Egeris; G. 525.

10. Quid consilii—quod consilium; G. 438, 5; 396, ΙΠ. 2, 3), (3).

11. Ignorare. Give object3 G. 525, 2.—Arbitraris. Objcct? G. 550.

12. Ο tempora! G. 381.—consul. To whom does Cicero refer?
Whowas, the other consul? See Introduction, p. 138. The consuls, it
will be remembered, were the two chief magistr-atesi, or joint presidente
of the commonwealth.

13. Immo. . ‚etiam. Observe the accumulation of particleS, with
the force of each. Immo, nay more, streugthening the previous state-
ment, which contained only a part of the truth.

14. Publici. . particeps. Catiline, notwithstanding the active
part which he had taken in the⁸ conspiracy, had the effrontery to take
his seat in the senate—Consilii. G. 399, 2, 2).

15. Nos; expressed because emphatic. G. 446.

16. Viri fortes. In irony—Rei publicam G. 385, 2.—vide-
mur=nobis videmur, seem to our-selues, i. e., think, imagine z-si vite·
mus; Subjunctive by Attraction. The conclusion is satis facere, not
videmur. G. 527, 3.-Istius; G. 450, 3. ’

18. Jussu consulis, by the order of the con-nd, i. e., of Cicero.
This could be done by virtue of a decree os the senate passed on the
twenty-first of October,.which clothed the consuls with dictatorial powers
for the safety of the republic. See introduction, p. 139.-Jam pridem
oportebat. Observe the force of the Imperfect. G. 467, 2, 1).
