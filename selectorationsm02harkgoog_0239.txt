FOURTH ORATION AGAINST CATILINE. 211 ⁶

Ι

25. cogitate quantis. . ,imperium una. . .delerit. This is a 45
good illustration of the vigor and precisiou which often characterize an
abridged Latin sentence. The full form would be as follows: coquant
quantis laboribus imperium fundatum sit quod una nox paene delevit. By
the use of the participle for the verb fundatum sit, the relative quod be-
came unnecessary, and was accordingly omitted, and the verb delevit
being thus brought into an indirect question after quanti-5, was changed
to the subjunctive delerit = deleverit. Render either according to the
full form or as follows: Consider how nearly one niyht destroyed (or how
one niyht well niyh destroyed) our empire founded by how yreat labora, etc.
