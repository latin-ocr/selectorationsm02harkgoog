qs my advice and (Ζίοοοιινεες i. e., of the advice contained iu my oration, 19
sn instance of hendiadys. G. 704, 11. 2.—Si quam3 supply medicinam
afferre.

1⁷. Unum genus. Cicero characterizes the first class of the cou-
spirators as debtors who are possessed of property, and not therefore
really insolvent—Est eorum, concubis of those, lit„ ὼ os mona—Eorum
Predicate Gen. G. ‘mk—Magno in aere alieno, thouqlt deeply in
debt- .

19. Dissolvi, ιο· be set free, i. e., from debt. Others render, to be
separated from them, i. e., from their possessione. Perhaps Cicero se-
lected an ambiguous term for the purpose of suggesting to his hearers
both interpretatione—speeies, the mental ammarum, referring doubt-
less to their wealth and social position.

21. Tu.. λιι. ..sis, et dubites, oan you be. ..and hoe'itate? Ob-
serve the repetition of tu,- G. 704, Π. 3.—Agris; G. 419, ΙΙΙ-Βία,
ᾱιιῢίῐθες Potential Subj. G. 4815. ’

⁷ 22. Familia, with a retinue of servants.

23. Acquirere ad fidem, to add to your eredit, i. e., by paying your
deth.

25. Omnium, os all Utin-qs ,⁰ Objective Gen. with vastatione. G. 396,
11.—An tabulas novas, or new accounts. Supply aspectas. Laws
were sometimes passed reducing all debts in a uniform ratio, as by one-
sourth or one-half. The Valerian st, enacted in the year 86 Β. 0., re·
duced all debts to one-fourth of their previous amount. 'l'he debts thus
reduced were entered upon new tables (tabulae novae). Catiline had
promised his followers such a relief from the weight of iudebtedness
with which so many of them were overwhelmed.

27. Tabulae novae. . merum auctionariae, new rables, but thoro
of 1}oe audien. There is iu this passage a play upon the word wbulae.
Cicero says debts shall be reduced, not indeed by any new law, but by
the public sale of the property of the debtor.

29. Quod, this, i. e., to sell their property as is implied in mactio-
nanae.

30. Neque, and not.—1‹l; in apposition with the clause certare, ete.
—Certure. . ‚praediun-um, to semoy-qk to meet tlte interest by meam os

31. Et locupletioribus. . ,πίοι-ωηατ, we should fiand (lit, use)

remur, agreeing with his.

33. Permauebuut. Supply in mimalia.

36⁶ Alterum genus. 'l'he second class consists of insolvent debt- ·
ors who are ambitious of power.
