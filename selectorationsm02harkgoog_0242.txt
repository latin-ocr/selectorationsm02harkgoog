Tus poet, A. Licinius Archias, whom Cicero here defends,
was a native of Antioch, in Syria. He early acquired a reputa·
tion among his fellow-citizens by his poetical gists and his ready
wit, and subsequently during an extended course of travel through
various parts of Asia Minor, Greece, and Southern Italy, he be-

the right of citizenship.

franchise to all residents in Italy who were already enrolled as
citizens in any allied town, provided they presented their names
to the praetor within sixty days. Archias at once availed him·
self of the provisions of this law by presenting his name for

in ’ΤΟ Β. 0., he was absent from Rome in the retinue of Lucullus,
and accordingly was not enrolled in the censors‘ lists. Taking
advantage of this fact, a certain Gratius brought an action against
him on the charge of having illegally assumed the franchise, and
