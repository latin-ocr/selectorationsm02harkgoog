ORA'I'ION FOR THE Pom* ARCHIAS. 215

pupil of Archias, at once undertook the defence. He proved that

- his client was in the strictest sense a Roman citizen, as the three

conditione specified in the law had all been fulfilled: 1. He had
been enrolled as a citizen of Heraclea, as was proved by the tes-
timony of her citizens and of Lu‘cullus, though the archives of
the town could not be produced in proof, as they had been de-
stroyed by fire; 2. He resided in Italy when the law was enact-
ed; 3. He presented his name within the prescribed time to the
praetor, as the record of the transaction itself showed.

Having thus completed the directly argumentative portion of
. the defence, the orator proceeded in the second place to set forth
the praises of poetry and letters, to enlarge upon the value of a
life devoted to polite and learned pursuits, and thus to show that
the presence of Archias in Rome was a public blessing, and that
even if he were not already a citizen, it would be the best and
wisest course for the state to confer the franchise upon him,
rather than lose the society and services of so valuable a man and
so gifted a poet.

The result of the trial is not known, though there seem to be
good reasons for the opinion that the defence was successful.
