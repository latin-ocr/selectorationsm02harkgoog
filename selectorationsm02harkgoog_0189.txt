18. Incolumes, See Syn. L. O. 321. 13

21. Retorquet oculos, e saucibus ereptam. Catilius is here
compared to a wild beast which looks wishsully back at the prey which
has been rescued from it.

l. Quam. . ‚ereptam esse, whose roseus from Itis jam Ῐιο mourm, 14
lit„ which to have been matclaed from Itis jaws he meum. The clause
cannot, of course, be literally rendered; we may, however, say, which Ιιε
mourm lo see εηαίοῘιεᾱ from Ῐιὶσ jam—Quae quidem laetari mihi
videtur3 contrasted with quam e. . ‚luget—Quam i. e., haec urbs.

2. Quod evomuerit. The city's reason for rej0icing. Hence the

II.—V. Cicero’s Defence aqainst the Oharqe of too Great

been such, Catiline’s arrest and execution would have been an easy
matter. The great difficulty in the case was the fact that the senators
were divided in opinion on that question.

7. N on. . ,mea eulpa. By a common ellipsis, admissible both in
Latin and in English, this appears as the conclusion of the condition, si
quis, etc. The real conclusion, however, is something like this: My
dasence is this, or I reply.—Culpa; Predicate noun.
