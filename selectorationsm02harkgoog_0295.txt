ORArmN Fon MARCELLUS. 263

Dictator, and thanking him for this exorciso of his aecustomed
clemency and mercy.

Marcellae, being thus honorably recalled and restored in full
to all the rights of Roman citizenship, could no longer refuse to
comply with the earnest entreaties of his friend Cicero to return
to his native land. Accordingly, after some delay, he started
upon his homeward journey, but he had proceeded only as far as
Athens when he was assassinated by one of his attendants. His
body was burned in the Academy, and a marble monument was
erected to his memory. ¹
