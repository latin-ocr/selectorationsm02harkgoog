PAO!

13 go, but to escort to the gate. See note on Ut te prosequantur, p. 8, line
82. But, instead of the usual kind farewell, the words (verbis) here re-
ferred to ane words of execration. Perhaps verbis refers to the closing
paragraph in the first oration3 Hisce ominibus, eta—Ipsumegredien-
tem, qoiny of Itis oum accord, lit„ μυίης] himseff.

ὅ. Abiit. . ‚erupit A climax expressive of exultant joy. 'Ibe
asyndeton adds to the effect. G. 704, 1. 1. Abeo, to 9⁰ away, gives the
simple idea of departure, excedo, to withdraw, adds the idea of escape,
evadere, to escape, is used especially of fliyht by night, or in secret, and
erumpere, to break away, involves the use of violent or forcible means.

6. A monstro illo, by that monster, i. e.‚ by Catiline.—Moenibus
ipsis, ayaz'nat the city itself. Moenia, properly designating the walls of a
city, is sometimes used of the city itself.

8. Sine controversia, without doubt.

9. Non jam, no lower, lit„ not now, i. e.‚ as before—Sica illa.
Mentioned on p. 6, line 22 3 Quoties tibi jam extorta est sica ista de mani·

10. In camp03 i. e.‚ in the Campus Martius. See p. 5, line 6.—1n

soro. See p. 6, line 123 te pridie Kalendas «Ianuarias stetisse in comitio

cum telo. The comitium, it must be remembered, was a part of the

Forum—In curia. See p. 12, line 153 Desinant obsidere cum yladiis

curiam—Intra domesticos parietes, within the walls of our houset,

referring to the plot to assassinate Cicero in his own house. See p. 4,

line 22.

11. Pertimescemus3 intransitive-Loco motus est, was dis·
lodyed from his position, i. e.‚ from the strong position which he held he-
fore3 a military expression. G. 425, 3, 3).

12.⁰Nullo impediente3 Abl. Absol. Why is nullus used instead
of nemo? G. 457, 2.

14. Ex occultis.. ,latrocinium from secret plot-s into open rob·
bery. Occultis with insidiis is nearly or quite pleonastic, but is used to
balance apertum. See Lat. Comp. 6153 615, V.

15. Quod vero. Vero (but) is the general connective of the whole
sentence, while quod (because or that) only connects its own clause to
esse afflictum et prqfliqatum. Construe thus: Vero quanto. . . putatis, qnod
non. . ,extulit quod. . ,cyressus est, etse—Quod non. . .extulit, because
he did not carry away his daqyer bloody, i. e.‚ because he had not made it
bloody by assassinating Cicero, Observe the emphatic position of cru·
cutum, which has the force of a predicate adjective. The same remark
also applies to vivis, incolumes, and stantem.

16. Vivis nobis3 Abl. Absol.

1⁷. Ei e manibus, See note on tibi de manibus, p. 6, line 22.
