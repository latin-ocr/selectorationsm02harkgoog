3. Illa nimis antiqua, 1120oe well-known cases, as too ancient. G.
450, 4; 442. The plural illa implies that Cicero had in mind a class os
cases os which he gives that of Ahala as an example—Quod, that, or
’camely that. The clause is in apposition with illa. G. 363, 5.

4. Ahala, Maelium. Servilius Ahala, master of the horse under
the dictator Cincinnatus, was sent in the year 439 Β. C. torarrest Spurius
Maelius, who was suspected of aiming at regal power. Maelius refused
to obey the summons os the dictator, and was accordingly slain on the
spot. It is, however, by no means certain that the suspicions against
Maelius were well founded. By distributing grain among the poorer
classes at a time os great scarcity, he made himself the idol of the Plebe-
ians, but an object of hatred and suspicion to the Patricians. It is,
accordingly, impossible to say whether he fell as a traitor to his country,

or as a martyr to his own generosity. Cicero doubtless believed him
guilty.—N ovis rebus, revolution ‚· lit. new thinys. Gr. 384.
