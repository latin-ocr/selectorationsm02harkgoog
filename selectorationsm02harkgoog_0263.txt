ORATION FOR THE MANILIAN LAW. 233

himself with Tigranes, King of Armenia, by giving him his
daughter in marriage, formed the bold design of expelling the
Romans from their extensive possessions in Asia Minor. For a
time, brilliant success seemed likely to crown the undertaking.
Oity after city threw open its gates and welcomed the victor as a
deliverer from the Roman yoke. Elated by these early successes,
he issued an order almost unparalleled in cruelty, for a general
massacre of Roman citizens in Asia, an order which was executed
with relentless severity. One Roman general after another was
sent against him, some of whom achieved great and important
results, but still the struggle continued. At length in the year
74 B. 0., Lucullus was appointed commander of the Roman ar-
mies in Asia. For seven years he prosecuted the war with great
vigor and success3 he conquered Mithridates, took the greater
part of PontuS, invaded Armenia, defeated Tigranes, and took the
Armenian capita13 but this brilliant career of conquest was finally
checked by the disaffection of his soldiers. Accordingly, in the
'year 67 Β. O„ he was superseded by Glabrio, who proved to be a
very inefficient commander. Mithridates and Tigranes promptly
availed themselves of the opportunity thus offered them of re-
covering the territory and power which they had lost. It was
at this crisis in the Roman affairs in the East, that the tribune
Caius Manilius, in the spring of 66 Β. O„ moved that Pompey,
who had just achieved such signal success in the war against the
pirateS, and who was still in Asia at the head of a large and vic·
torious army, should be intrusted with the chief command in the
war against Mithridates and Tigranes. The bill, generally known
as the Manilian law, proposed to clothe Pompey with almost un-
limited power, and accordingly met with violent opposition from
Catulus and HortensiuS, on the ground that it would be perilous
to the best interests of the republic to place such extraordinary
powers in the hands of any one man. It was, however, warmly
advocated by Caesar and Cicer0, and was carried by acclamation.

Pompey, on receiving this appointment, hastened to encoun-
ter Mithridates, over whom he soon gained a signal victory. The
vanquished king barely escaped with his life, and, unable to find
shelter in Armenia, the dominions of his own son—'in-law, he
made his way through the ,rugged defiles of the Caucasian Moun-
tains to the Grimea, where he finally terminated his life with his
own hand. The kingdom of Pontus became a Roman province,
